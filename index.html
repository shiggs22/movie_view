			<h2>Movie of the Month: Dumb and Dumber</h2>
					<p>In light of the now in progress movie Dumb and Dumber Too,
					staring Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas and Jeff Daniels as 
					Harry Dunne. The duo are back and we can't be more excited! Since
					the first movie came out back in 1994 we the people were waiting
					to see and hoping to see the 2 back for another take on the Dumb
					and Dumber franchise. We were let down when the movie Dumb and
					Dumberer came out; it just seemed to be a slap in the faces of the
					people who loved the first movie. The take on the this prequel When
					Harry meet Lloyd was such an awful movie that most people couldn't 
					watch it for more than 30 minutes! We understand that Harry and Lloyd
					are "dumb" but come on, this was just down right stupid of a movie.
					So after that massive fail, we all wanted Jim Carrey and
					Jeff Daniels back together, on the big screen, playing the characters
					once again so we can get a laugh that we all remembered from the past.
					So, the Farelly Brothers answered our prayers and got the team
					together to make a true second movie to the late Dumb and Dumber!</p>
					
					<p><strong>Plot:</strong>Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the title 		    
					roles (though viewers may find themselves debating which is which) in
					this genially low-brow comedy. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry
					Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are two intellectually-challenged best friends
					who share an apartment so messy that gangsters aren't sure how to
					trash the place; the guys also have a certain problem
					not difficult to understand) holding on to jobs. Lloyd is 
				    working as a limo driver in Rhode Island when he picks up a 
					beautiful and wealthy woman named Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) 
					who is being taken to the airport. Lloyd immediately falls head 
					over heels in love with Mary, and when she leaves a briefcase at
					the airport, he's determined to return it in hopes of impressing
					her. Lloyd isn't able to get aboard Mary's flight 
					(though not for lack of trying). Harry has a van decorated to 
					look like a dog (to promote his failing dog-grooming business),
					and the pair hop in the Poochmobile to find Mary in Aspen.
					What Lloyd and Harry don't know is that the briefcase is 
					full of money, which Mary deliberately left at the airport 
					as a ransom payment to save the life of her kidnapped 
					husband. Incidentally, Lloyd's chipped front tooth happens 
					to be real; while Jim Carrey had the injured tooth capped 
					many years ago, he thought a broken smile would suit Lloyd's 
					character and had the cap removed for the duration of filming.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Review:</strong>Lowbrow, politically incorrect and stupid
					      with jut-jawed determination, just about every minute of 
					      "Dumb and Dumber," now available on home video, is inspired, 
					      irreverent, spark-driven comedy that takes you places you never 
					      thought a movie would go -- even a Jim Carrey movie.

						Forget the shocking toilet scene in "Pulp Fiction" -- we may now 
						pass directly to two rib-splitting ones in "Dumb and Dumber" that 
						reach new levels of low laughs but high spirits.

						This wacky buddy road film starring Carrey ("The Mask," "Ace 
						Ventura," "Batman Forever") and Jeff Daniels ("Speed," 
						"Gettysburg") has a brilliant glow of intelligence behind the 
						stupidness. It's easily the funniest movie of the year.

						Why? Because it relies on the circumstances of the everyday with 
						a firm finger on the pulse of what ordinary guys (it's a guyish 
						movie) think about doing, but never come close to pulling off. 
						And it cleverly, often riotously, mirrors some of the really stupid 
 						things plain folks will do in a world stacked against them.

						"Dumb and Dumber" is not so much about dumb guys as it is about 
						earnest guys. And people can be pathetically funny when they are 
						just being earnest lunks.

						Whether engaged in pranks, or putting the make on women, or 
						stumbling through attempts to finesse, "Dumb and Dumber's" two 
						lovable losers blow the lid off pretensions and go on a kind of 
						idiot ride with such amazing dexterity and often bold caprice that
						the film becomes a surprising satire of American culture.

						With "Dumb and Dumber" the amazingly elastic Carrey assures his 
						place as film's reigning king of comic spontaneity (Robin Williams
						 dethroned?). Playing a character named Lloyd Christmas, he could 
						 almost carry "Dumb and Dumber" by himself.

						His chipped front tooth, crazy mouth formations, electric- charged
						eyes, dimpled grins and nutty bowl-style haircut make him an 
						insistent comic presence even before he utters a single word or 
						takes the first pratfall.

						But somebody (writer-director Peter Farrelly and his fellow 
						scribes, brother Bobby Farrelly and Bennett Yellin) had a buddy 
						movie in mind. Daniels, fresh from a bout of serious screen roles,
						was an inspired choice to play the seemingly "dumber" guy, Harry 
						Dunne.

						We meet Lloyd and Harry in Providence, R.I., where they're 
						roommates and best friends. Harry is trying to start up a dog 
						groom ing business called Mutt Cutts and has decked out his van as
						a "muttmobile" to look like a sheepdog on wheels, floppy ears and 
						all. He's totally inept, of course, and his business bites the 
						dust.

						Carrey's Lloyd is a neat-as-a-pin chauffeur. He gets smitten by a 
						beautiful passenger, played by Lauren Holly ("Picket Fences"), who
						inadvertently leaves a briefcase behind.

						"Dumb and Dumber" is a slapstick-lover's wallow, with emphasis on 
						the outlandish and the crude as Lloyd and Harry, both fired from 
						their jobs, take off across the country to catch up with Holly in
						Aspen and give her the briefcase.

						It's by no means a perfect movie, but it is well photographed, 
						crisply paced, and has the kind of plucky spontaneity often 
						lacking in contemporary comedies. More than wacky antics drives 
						this cheerful film -- "Dumb and Dumber" is riddled with smarts, 
						and that's the part you end up admiring the most.</p>
