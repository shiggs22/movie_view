			<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p> Here at Movie View Review, we take the time to watch movies from 
				past to present and give you information about the movies. We love movies
				and I'm sure, since you are at this site, you love them too! So, every
				month we will choose a movie to write about and give you feed back on
				whether or not you should see it. if you should watch this movie or not. 
				As you can see, we give a brief description on the movie, some favorite 
				quotes, and information on the main Actors themselves. Feel free to look 
				around and sign up to our site so you can add your thoughts on the 
				movie, your favorite quotes, and your recommendation.

			<h2>Movie of the Month</h2>
				<h3>Dumb and Dumber</h3>
					<p>In light of the now in progress movie Dumb and Dumber 2,
					staring Jim Carey as Lloyd Christmas and Jeff Daniels as 
					Harry Boyd. The duo are back and we can't be more excited! Since
					the first movie came out back in 1994 we the people were waiting
					to see and hoping to see the 2 back for another take on the Dumb
					and Dumber franchise. We were let down when the movie Dumb and
					Dumberer came out; it just seemed to be a slap in the faces of the
					people who loved the first movie. The take on the the prequel When
					Harry meet Lloyd we such an awful movie that most people couldn't 
					watch it for more than 30 minutes! We understand that Harry and Lloyd
					are "dumb" but come on, this was just down right stupid of a movie.
					So after that massive fail of a movie, we all wanted Jim Carey and
					Jeff Daniels back together, on the big screen, playing the characters
					once again so we can get a laugh that we all remembered from the past.
